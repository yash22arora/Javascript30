# Atomic Symbol Generator

This is a cool tool to turn yourself into an atomic element! User is required to put in his/her name, weight and age and the code arranges the info in the form of an atomic element as shown, along with the configuration (based on the age).

   - Atomic Number --> Age
   - Atomic Weight --> Weight
   - Element Name --> First Name
